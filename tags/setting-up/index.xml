      <description>Knowing very little about creating websites, my first choice was to try to setup a site on Wordpress. My experience was not so smooth. It involved setting up databases and installing large binaries just to get a simple site going. When I spoke to a friend about this, he introduced me to static websites, which seem to work great for me. Between Jekyll and Hugo, I felt that Hugo themes were better and has really good emacs integration and hence will be easy to integrate into my existing workflow.</description>
